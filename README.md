# Typing Test

## Overview

The Typing Test is a simple command-line application that allows users to practice their typing speed and accuracy. The program presents a random phrase for the user to type, measures the time taken, and calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) as well as the accuracy percentage.

## Features

- Randomly selected phrases for typing practice.
- Measures typing speed in words per minute.
- Calculates accuracy based on character correctness.
- Allows users to retry the test as many times as they wish.
- Displays results after each attempt.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MSivananthan/typing-test.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```

3. No additional packages are required since the program uses built-in Python libraries.

## Usage
